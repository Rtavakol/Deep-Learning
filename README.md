# Deep Learning

This repository contains my deep learning notebooks. 

## Image Classification
[Digit Recognizer - Categorical](https://github.com/Rtavakol/Deep-Learning/blob/master/Digit%20Recognizer/Digit_recognizer_CNN_experiment.ipynb)\
It contains different experiments on CNN to find optimum parameters for digit recognizer model.
